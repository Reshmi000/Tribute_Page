He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s earliest political lieutenants, he organized peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quite India Movement.

            <h1>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's contribution to India's independence movement</h1>
            <p>During the 1930 Salt Satyagraha, Patel was sentenced to three months imprisonment. In March 1931, Patel headed the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress. 
                Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel had participated in Gandhi's individual disobedience, was arrested in 1940, and faced nine months of imprisonment. Patel lost more than 20 pounds of weight during his period in jail.
                During Quit India Movement (1942), Sardar Patel was arrested and imprisoned from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar.
                He led the Congress Party in the 1937 elections and was a major contender for the post of Congress President 1937 but due to Gandhi's pressure, Patel withdrew his nomination and Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as the Congress President.
                Patel was once again the leading candidate for the post of President of the Indian National Congress but Gandhi once again intervened and Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as the President of the Congress.
                After this, Nehru was invited by the British Government to form the Interim Government. If Sardar Patel would have been elected as the President of the Congress, perhaps Sardar Patel could have been the first Prime Minister of the country.

            <h1> Sardar as Father of All India Services</h1>
            <p> He was also instrumental in the creation of the All Indian Services which he described as the country's "Steel Frame". In his address to the probationers of these services, he asked them to be guided by the spirit of service in day-to-day administration. He reminded them that the ICS was no-longer neither Imperial, nor civil, nor imbued with any spirit of service after Independence. His exhortation to the probationers to maintain utmost impartiality and incorruptibility of administration is as relevant today as it was then. "A civil servant cannot afford to, and must not, take part in politics. Nor must he involve himself in communal wrangles. To depart from the path of rectitude in either of these respects is to debase public service and to lower its dignity," he had cautioned them on 21 April 1947. 
                He, more than anyone else in post-independence India, realised the crucial role that civil services play in administering a country, in not merely maintaining law and order, but running the institutions that provide the binding cement to a society. He, more than any other contemporary of his, was aware of the needs of a sound, stable administrative structure as the lynchpin of a functioning polity. The present-day all-India administrative services owe their origin to the man's sagacity and thus he is regarded as Father of modern All Indian Services.
